# Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience

## Meet the Team
Hoiiii!ðŸ‘‹ We are the [Open Science Working Group](https://anatomy-neurosciences.com/initiatives/openscience/) at Amsterdam UMC's Anatomy and Neuroscience Department, a diverse team of neuroscientists, including Ph.D. researchers, postdocs, research assistants, and technicians, all united by our passion for Open Science.

## Project background
Our project seeks to **create a tailored Open Science Guidebook for Neuroscience**, addressing knowledge gaps hindering open science practices. The guidebook will offer step-by-step guidance on data management, pre-registration, protocol sharing, analysis code sharing, and open-access publishing. Uniquely designed for the diverse subfields of neuroscience, it consolidates existing resources and introduces new content to address specific challenges. Accessible to researchers at all levels, it aims to empower students, early-career scientists, and professionals, fostering collaboration, reproducibility, and transparency within the neuroscience community. 

## Next steps
The immediate focus is on **officially launching the project**, incorporating all chapters by including relevant text, figures, and graphical material to enhance accessibility. Disseminating the content within our department and beyond is a crucial mid-term objective. 

Looking further ahead, we aspire to cultivate a community that actively contributes to maintaining and updating the guidebook's content, ensuring long-term sustainability and relevance.

## Staying connected
ðŸŒ± We would like to stay in contact with all the amazing people of the OS community. We look forward to collaborating with other neuroscientists to create a supportive environment where everyone can thrive and reach their full potential. 

ðŸ§  We would like to hear from you, and we are looking forward to contributors, if you are interested, contact us via email open.science.anw@amsterdamumc.nl

âœ¨ Many, many thanks to our mentor from OLS-8 cohort, Siobhan Hall, for guiding us through the process, providing feedback, and giving a broad perspective!
